## Project Motivation 

I was interested in knowing what kind of Members of Parliament did we choose in the General Election of India 2019.
Questions of interest were :

1. What percent of MPs have criminal cases registered against them ?
2. Which states contributed most in polluting the parliament ?
3. What is the distribution of MPs on ground of Education Qualifications ? 
4. Is there a correlation between education qualification and criminal cases of MPS ?
